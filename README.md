## ABOUT
This is a fun little project i made with ThreeJS in React and Belender. The map is alterd by me but it isn't my creation, it belongs to the offical game. I have used blender to touch up ceratin parts of the map and made the path for the camera
movement path and exported the path into json points and then mapped out through ThreeJS vectors to create the path. This wasent a long project and i defenetly could have added more details and smoothness to the website but i was happy with 
how this short project came out as well. The main point was just showing my knowledge in working with 3d elements in coding and a little bit of creating and re-structiring 3d models in Blender.
